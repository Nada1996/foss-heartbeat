What I usually do in that case is just define the minimal required model class inside the migration.

That way you can still use ActiveRecord in the migration without running the risk of the class not being there at some point down the line.

It also does not add a lot of complexity since usually its just an empty Subclass of ActiveRecord::Base with maybe one belongs_to statement (whatever you need to do the migration).

I am still looking into it @F3PiX but: I realised that first and foremost, in order to change it, the inline-code should be moved out of the inline-code class (for example, into inline-code).

After that, you can add a inline-code to it.

I think the only way to override the color of a inline-code is to also add 

block-code.

However there's still a couple of strange things happening with the css (the collapse will pick up that red color, which I am not sure we want).

@F3PiX that's okay, I understand :)

@mkalininait I do send emails to mentors, but they're usually updates about the program and their next steps — I don't email them about being added to a team or anything like that — I'd leave that up to the robots ;)

As an alternative, a team could be valid (to apply) without a mentor (because we have a validation on project anyway so they can't apply without a project; last year the process was different and the mentor in the team ensured we knew which project each team was attached to), and we pull the mentor information into the team when the team is officially selected.

@F3PiX I think the teams app might need some restructuring anyway, and the navbar should reflect that :) as Carsten pointed out it's difficult when the menu items change throughout the summer according to the different phases, however I think we could definitely change it into a 'real' bootstrap navbar.

Is it possible for you to precise if it should be done by 
- adding two links to existing solution (as stated in original task description) 
- adding some drop down list (as suggest @carpodaster) 
- changing menu into bootstrap navbar (as suggest @alicetragedy) 

or you want to decide on this during the summer of RGSoC (possibly changing/adding more tasks to Nav Bar Revamp milestone)?

Therefore 50812f9 undos firing the team model's validations when saving a role and instead displays the team's own error message in the role's form, if adding/editing a role does not suit the constraints of the team the role is connected to.

@anikalindtner as far as I remember (however, this conversation is pretty far away, so maybe someone will be able to fill in the blanks) we decided against a "set amount" and for a range, and wanted to change the question to be more general (something along the lines of "how much is needed in your city") because we felt that a) asking for students to break down costs would be too intrusive and b) we had the idea of having the students themselves look up in a calculator the living costs for their own city.

Since this is quite specific to the teams app, I feel like info that is relevant to the use of the teams app (how to log in, how to look for a partner using our app, how to fill out the application form properly, how to edit your profile) should be in there somewhere.

I'm happy to have a discussion about this and see pros and cons of both approaches :)
This is kind of a "structural" question I guess (and might help with how we want to structure the navigation in the teams app as well): do we want to separate areas in the teams app by role?

just a thought: If you are testing this on staging (where you might have a “student” role as well as an “organiser” role) that might be the reason why you can delete the empty role and a “simple” student might not be able to.

then it looks like it was magically half-fixed at least :face_with_tears_of_joy: (I think that not being able to remove the role was the more critical/annoying part of the bug, so it might not be an issue that needs an urgent fix after all if students can remove the empty roles themselves).

I thought the student dashboard is meant to be something like that, but don't take my word for it, ask your mentor :-)  

AFAIK orga's have full access to all the namespaces.
(2 (2 (2 I) (2 (2 (2 (2 (2 thought) (2 (2 (2 the) (2 (2 student) (2 dashboard))) (2 (2 is) (2 (2 meant) (2 (2 to) (2 (2 be) (2 (2 something) (2 (3 like) (2 that))))))))) (2 ,)) (2 but)) (2 (2 (2 do) (2 n't)) (2 (2 (2 take) (2 (2 my) (2 word))) (2 (2 for) (2 it)))))) (2 (2 ,) (2 (2 (1 (2 ask) (2 (2 your) (2 mentor))) (3 (3 (3 (3 :--RRB-) (2 (2 AFAIK) (2 (2 orga) (2 's)))) (2 (2 (2 have) (2 full)) (2 access))) (2 (2 to) (2 (2 all) (2 (2 the) (2 namespaces)))))) (2 .))))
So orga's would need access to write to all the student's dashboards at the same time, while one student only has access to her own dashboard.

I think this can be done with a setup similar to the current conferences: only orga's add them, and they show up on several places in the app.
(2 (2 (2 (2 (2 I) (2 (2 think) (2 (2 this) (2 (2 can) (2 (2 be) (2 (2 done) (2 (2 with) (2 (2 (2 a) (2 setup)) (2 (2 similar) (2 (2 to) (2 (2 the) (2 (2 current) (2 conferences))))))))))))) (2 :)) (2 (2 (1 (2 (1 (2 only) (2 orga)) (2 (2 's) (2 (3 add) (2 them)))) (2 ,)) (2 and)) (2 (2 they) (2 (2 (2 show) (2 up)) (2 (2 on) (2 (2 (2 several) (2 places)) (2 (2 in) (2 (2 the) (2 app))))))))) (2 .))
So, IMO you don't need to build an orga dashboard as well.
(2 (2 So) (2 (2 ,) (2 (2 (2 IMO) (2 you)) (2 (2 (2 (2 do) (2 n't)) (2 (2 need) (1 (2 to) (2 (2 (2 build) (1 (2 an) (2 (2 orga) (2 dashboard)))) (2 (2 as) (2 well)))))) (2 .)))))

The supervisor/orga combination is a thing.

How I understand the current process: 1) we find interesting conferences around the world and in teams' locations; 2) we contact organizers and arrange diversity tickets and lightning talk spots (if possible); 3) we make a list of conferences who accepted our request; 4) we make a conference raffle.

When I first suggested that we ask students for local conferences they would like to attend, I saw it more as a "student tells their supervisor about a conference" type of situation, not an extra feature in the teams app, for the simple reason that we don't actually have an exact plan of how this would work, and adding a feature that has been poorly thought-through is imho worse that adding some of the conferences manually into the teams app.

Before having the suggested conference in the list of conferences students can apply to, one of us needs to contact organisers of the conference anyway and have the free ticket approval; so at the end of the day, I don't think having it in a text field in the app or in a list supervisors send us would make much of a difference.

After opening each profile, you have to scroll down to their activity to figure out from each edition they are and it would be nice to have something more immediate.

The browsing on history feature could be useful to show to the world what is our program and what it has been done throughout the years.

This could easily be done with a selection box on the Teams page, where you select the year and the table would display the teams of that year.

My team fills out their daily logs on their blog and it gets fed into the teams app.

I can read it on the same day it's "due" on the teams app, but they get an email reminder every day nonetheless.

The easy solution would be that they just fill it out on the teams app.

I think it would be a huge shame that they abandon their blog (which they can continue to use even after the summer to track their progress) and even more of a shame if we are the ones to encourage them to do so.

I think the best solution would to find out why the teams app doesn't recognize this feed and sends them the email even though the log is there, on time, on the app, available for everyone to read :smiling_face_with_open_mouth_and_smiling_eyes:

The issue at hand is that we get to the comments controller which redirects back to the object that the comment was created on and that object is an Activity.
(2 (2 (2 (2 The) (1 issue)) (2 (2 at) (2 hand))) (2 (2 (2 is) (2 (2 that) (2 (2 we) (2 (2 get) (2 (2 to) (2 (2 (2 the) (2 (2 comments) (2 controller))) (2 (2 which) (2 (2 (2 (2 redirects) (2 back)) (2 (2 to) (2 (2 the) (2 object)))) (2 (2 (2 (2 that) (2 (2 (2 the) (2 comment)) (2 (2 was) (2 (2 created) (2 on))))) (2 and)) (2 (2 that) (2 (2 object) (2 (2 is) (2 (2 an) (2 Activity)))))))))))))) (2 .)))
Thus redirect_to redirects to the activity_path(activity).

That we have differnt kinds of activity is nothing that rails knows about.

So the current fix works because it creates an activity_path, but it would fall apart as soon as we have another commentable to which we want to redirect to within the root namespace.
(2 (2 (2 (2 (2 (2 So) (2 (2 (2 the) (2 (2 current) (3 fix))) (2 (3 works) (2 (2 because) (2 (2 it) (2 (2 creates) (2 (2 an) (2 activity_path)))))))) (2 ,)) (2 but)) (2 (2 it) (2 (2 would) (2 (2 (2 fall) (2 apart)) (2 (2 (2 as) (2 soon)) (2 (2 as) (2 (2 we) (2 (2 have) (2 (2 (2 another) (2 commentable)) (2 (2 (2 to) (2 which)) (2 (2 we) (2 (2 want) (1 (2 to) (1 (2 (2 redirect) (2 to)) (1 (2 within) (2 (2 the) (2 (2 root) (2 namespace)))))))))))))))))) (2 .))
Another possible solution would be to subclass the comments controller and have something like a StatusUpdates::CommentsController?
(2 (2 (2 (2 Another) (2 (2 possible) (3 solution))) (2 (2 would) (2 (2 be) (2 (2 to) (2 (2 (2 (2 subclass) (2 (2 the) (2 (2 comments) (2 controller)))) (2 and)) (2 (2 have) (2 (2 something) (2 (2 (3 like) (2 (2 a) (2 StatusUpdates))) (2 :))))))))) (2 (2 :) (2 (2 CommentsController) (2 ?))))
This Controller then could live under /status_updates/comments and always redirect to a status update.

We had discussions on the navigation previously, and I - being a backender so be gentle, please  ;-) , - have the strong impression that a lot of the issues in the header are caused by the fact that we do not have implemented a proper Bootstrap navigation bar.

I'd love to have some of these issues fixed <3

On top of those, the tables on the teams and community pages are not responsive (I realise that this is a bigger issue which is why I don't think it can get done at the same pace as the above, but it would be great to think about a way of solving that someday)

The menu used to be inside the red header and it was not covering the activities (except when expanded and on mobile, but that's the exact same behaviour it has on mobile right now in this PR and I think it works well).

Just wanted to give my +1 on most of what has been discussed — I would keep the word requirements, would just stick to the link in the inline-code to the mentor guide (aka no checkbox to make sure they've read the guidelines), would widen the scope of the question by adding @klappradla's suggestions, and would improve the wording on the requirements field as suggested by @F3PiX (with Max' suggestions).

The thought behind it: most organisers don't really keep track of which hidden "features" are found in the dashboard controller, and since there is no menu for this anywhere, it becomes tedious to remember the URLs or look it up in the inline-code every time.

I haven't done fontend code in a while @F3PiX, so just some thoughts I have when looking at this PR, eventually not really relevant :see-no-evil_monkey: 

So first, I think it's weird, that this piece of code is **always** evaluated completely, even if the client does not show the respective form (80% of all cases I think).
(2 (2 (2 (2 (2 I) (2 (2 (2 have) (2 n't)) (2 (2 (2 done) (2 (2 fontend) (2 code))) (2 (2 in) (2 (2 (2 (2 (2 (2 a) (2 (2 while) (2 @F3PiX))) (2 ,)) (2 so)) (2 just)) (2 (2 (2 (2 some) (2 thoughts)) (2 (2 I) (2 (2 have) (2 when)))) (2 (2 (2 (2 (2 looking) (2 (2 at) (2 (2 this) (2 PR)))) (2 ,)) (2 eventually)) (2 (2 (1 not) (3 (2 really) (3 relevant))) (2 (2 :) (2 (2 see-no-evil_monkey) (2 :))))))))))) (2 So)) (2 (2 first) (2 (2 ,) (2 (2 I) (2 (2 think) (2 (2 it) (2 (2 (2 (2 's) (2 weird)) (2 ,)) (2 (2 that) (2 (2 (2 (2 this) (2 piece)) (2 (2 of) (2 code))) (2 (2 is) (2 (2 (2 (2 (2 **) (2 always)) (2 (2 **) (2 (2 evaluated) (2 completely)))) (2 ,)) (2 (2 even) (1 (2 if) (1 (2 (2 the) (2 client)) (1 (2 (2 does) (1 not)) (2 (2 show) (2 (2 (2 the) (2 (2 respective) (2 form))) (2 (2 -LRB-) (2 (2 (2 (2 80) (2 %)) (2 (2 of) (2 (2 (2 all) (2 cases)) (2 (2 I) (2 think))))) (2 -RRB-)))))))))))))))))))) (2 .))
Also, you're right, the application code, e.g. having max 3 attendances, should not be tied as closely to the fontend code.

I prefer to use data attributes here to just pass some data from Ruby to JS :winking_face:

I did not run this code, just wrote it straight here in the editor - so it prob won't work :winking_face:  Just added it to easier explain what I mean: init all the callbacks only if the respective form is actually there and get more data from the application.

However, since submitting an invalid number of conference attendances is already prevented on client side and then fully enforced on DB level (because save will never happen if the error is raised), I guess its also totally fine to give the client a 500.

@jancborchardt that's a very good point, and I think we can definitely improve that help section to make it more understandable :) The line "If you think something is unclear or should be improved" pointing to the issue tracker meant to suggest opening an issue along the lines of, "it's not very clear how to sign up for an account" or "I think the help page could be improved" rather than direct questions about the program, however reading it now I'm realising that it could be understood in another way.

I would either

a) remove inline-code from the the public interface, forward the inline-code methods to a private switcher instance transparently and keep calling inline-code on inline-code

That's why I wanted to set the limit on the inline-code: so it only applies on form inline-code for the relevant raffle round.

I can use either the inline-code option or the inline-code option and add a Proc or a symbol.

**Implementation**
- The character limit should be set at the view level in the form
- The length should *probably* be validated at the model level as well (that would be inline-code and inline-code)
- Each input field should contain a hint about the number of characters allowed
- *Bonus / nice to have*: character count going down as the user types (i.e. like you have on twitter) 

**The fields that need a character limit are the following:**

On the one hand, I think the maintainers would be interested in knowing whether their project is in a team's first or second choice; on the other hand, I think this would probably influence the maintainer's “favourite” teams maybe?

If you decide to make things private and only expose the inline-code method to the outer world *(which would make sense, since it's the only method that get's tested and it's the only thing invoked from outside)*, you need to "open up" the class.

Although we asked the students not to mention some of the information in certain fields (e.g. location), we still could sometimes tell from the writing where the student comes from (mentions of workshop names, university names etc.)

Intro: The step of signing in with a github handle creates a new user in the db and currently allows that signed in user to e.g. create a team.

The idea was to have a two-step process: first step, signing in, just requires the user to accept the oauth via github: this would give a user some sort of “read-only” access for anything that isn't their user profile (i.e. they can edit their user profile, but cannot do anything else like creating teams or applications).

I agree with Maria: if someone has joined the Teams App once and showed interest in coaching (e.g. in 2014) they might not go back to the Teams app if they've lost interest to say that they will not be coaching anymore and check a box.

With the "available" checkbox we could ask them to set the check and wait :) (which btw could be quite efficient if we improve the community page by adding the availability filter and some other ones)

And of course, the "available" checkbox would make it easier to make an active search.

I don't see how the "not available" checkbox would make it.

I imagine myself looking for a coach: there are 194 coaches in the database, if 50 people mark themselves "unavailable" (which is an optimistic number), I will still have 144 coaches to choose from.

If I look for a remote coach, I can't even filter them by location.

With the "available" checkbox, on the contrary, if 50 people mark themselves "available", it'd make my choice easier.

So it's 144 vs 50, and we should keep in mind that the amount of users in the database will grow and grow with time (and the mentioned difference will grow with it I guess).

Another thing is that we could actively agitate people to support RGSoC and set the "available" checkbox via social media, while with the "unavailable" checkbox if would look weird ("Please set the check 'unavailable' if you don't want to support RGSoC!"
(4 (2 (2 Another) (2 thing)) (2 (3 (1 (2 is) (1 (2 that) (1 (2 we) (1 (2 (2 could) (2 actively)) (1 (1 (1 (2 (2 agitate) (2 people)) (1 (2 to) (1 (2 (2 (2 support) (2 RGSoC)) (2 and)) (1 (2 set) (2 (2 (2 the) (2 (2 ``) (2 (2 available) (2 (2 '') (2 checkbox))))) (1 (2 via) (2 (2 social) (2 media)))))))) (2 ,)) (2 (2 while) (2 (2 with) (2 (2 (2 the) (2 (2 ``) (2 (2 unavailable) (2 (2 '') (2 checkbox))))) (2 (2 if) (2 (2 would) (1 (2 look) (2 (2 weird) (2 (2 -LRB-) (2 (2 (2 ``) (2 Please)) (2 (2 set) (2 (2 (2 the) (2 check)) (2 (2 (2 `) (2 (2 unavailable) (2 '))) (2 (2 if) (2 (2 you) (2 (2 (2 do) (2 n't)) (2 (2 want) (2 (2 to) (2 (2 support) (2 RGSoC)))))))))))))))))))))))) (2 !))

:)) So even leaving aside the motivational part, I believe that we will always have more people who want to mark themselves "available" than people who get annoyed by students and want to set the "unavailable" checkbox.

Sure, a coach will have the same experience regardless, but objectively, if a coach is attached to, say, two teams we end up choosing, and that in their profile they write down “availability: 40 hours / week” I doubt they'll have 40 hours / week for both teams, if that makes sense.

So, I think if we need more info from the coaches in order to rate the applications better, this needs to be done by the coaches after signing up and once they have a better idea of which teams they plan to coach.

We can still think about whether we want the coaches to be more involved in the application process and give them space in the application... but I am not sure if we can or should do it over the user profile?

As @carpodaster already wrote, “we removed the "hours per week" last year since it is too hard to estimate anyway and it won't save them from life that happens” — so I'd be in favour of sticking to that, and not adding the hours/week again as it's often not really a good indicator of how much time they will ultimately spend on the program helping a team.

**Notes** by mentors on applications for their projects are internally represented as inline-codes in the mentor namespace -> inline-code and use the inline-code table under the hood.

Yeah, I agree with the inside-out brackets (if only we had a pipe-operator in Ruby … :wink: )

I'm just unsure if binding the return value of higher order functions/methods to methods as their block parameter which in turn inline-codes the (implicit) block arg isn't something anyone with less than 4-5 years of Ruby experience immediately shies away from.

@mkalininait I think the problem is in the definition of current team
inline-code
and on your profile ,it seems like the teams are sorted by chronological order, so if I wasn't mistaken, this makes "Team Rackless pinguins [2016] " the first team , therefore = @current_team
inline-code

I am more in favor of either redirecting to the user profile directly (the unpolite, but easiest approach) or add an intermediate step where an applicant can edit their profile in-place (the more convenient, but also slightly hackier way).

@techchic quick tip: if you stay on the branch you created to make the first pull request (inline-code in your fork), you should be able to make the changes there and push — that way, you won't have to create a new PR, the changes will be added automatically to your current PR ( #668 )
Let me know if you need any help with that :)

Usually reviewing projects is pretty straight forward and we can make decisions right away, but in some cases, I found myself needing to check something with the maintainers (it usually takes a couple of days) or asking for feedback from the rest of the team, and then moving on.

As I usually review projects in batches, I sometimes forget which projects I've commented on or am waiting for an answer from; this leads to me clicking projects I've already partly “reviewed” when I go through new applications.
