Before you do, we kindly ask you to check if [it has already been reported](https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/rgsoc-teams/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug).\n+\n+If you do [file a new  bug report](https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/rgsoc-teams/issues/new), provide as many details as possible: how can the error be reproduced? What was the expected and what the actual behaviour? Can you provide an error message or a screenshot that illustrates the problem?\n+\n+\n+## Suggesting a new feature\n+\n+We are very open to feature requests and ideas to improve the Teams App. If you are a RGSoC student or supervisor who uses the Teams App on a daily basis over the course of the summer, your feedback on how the user experience can be improved is very valuable.\n+\n+As with filing a bug report, please check if the feature has [already been suggested](https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/rgsoc-teams/issues). If not, [share your ideas](https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/rgsoc-teams/issues/new)!\n+\n+\n+## Resolving an existing issue\n+\n+If you want to get involved with the RGSoC Teams App, the [list of open issues](https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/rgsoc-teams/issues) is a good starting point.\n+\n+### Finding an issue\n+\n+We have issues labelled as [`beginner-friendly`](https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/rgsoc-teams/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abeginner-friendly) suitable for your first steps in open source. See [`#pairwithme`](https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/rgsoc-teams/labels/%23pairwithme) for more involving issues and the standing invitation to work on a problem together (check [this great list of resources](http://www.pairprogramwith.me/) about (remote) pair programming).\n+\n+Before you start working, make sure no one else is already working on it: check if the issue has been assigned to someone already and/or comment on the issue. Adding comments is also the best way to ask questions about the issue at hand or if the issue is still valid.\n+\n+### Creating a Pull Request\n+\n+Clone/fork the repo and install the Teams App locally on your computer. Our [README](https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/rgsoc-teams/blob/master/README.md) provides setup instructions and hints).\n+\n+Before you start working, make sure tests pass locally: run `bundle exec rake spec` from the terminal in your local Teams App directory. There should be plenty of green dots (and some in yellow).\n+\n+### Create a Topic Branch\n+\n+All commits should go into a branch, not to `master` directly. Create a local branch:\n+\n+```\n+git checkout -b my-feature-branch\n+```\n+\n+If you've cloned the app a while ago, you want to make sure that your cloned `master` is in sync with the upstream. Github provives a help page on [how to keeping your fork in sync with `upstream/master`](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/).\n+\n+### Write Code\n+\n+We aim to follow the [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide) but we don't enforce it (i.e. there is no [RubuCop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop)). The most important thing is probably just proper indentation: two whitespaces.", "path": "CONTRIBUTING.md", "position": null, "original_position": 96, "commit_id": "d00af7acb9160a57bb79a27cc4a729c6f76f306c", "original_commit_id": "c27721e99d938c72463d25fb2462c98d2c2fdf63", "user": {"login": "alicetragedy", "id": 3143348, "avatar_url": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3143348?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alicetragedy", "html_url": "https://github.com/alicetragedy", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alicetragedy/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alicetragedy/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alicetragedy/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alicetragedy/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alicetragedy/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alicetragedy/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alicetragedy/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alicetragedy/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alicetragedy/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "body": "just noticed a minor typo: \"Rubucop\" instead of \"Rubocop\" \ud83d\ude07\n", "created_at": "2016-07-09T13:10:36Z", "updated_at": "2016-07-23T08:33:24Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/rgsoc-teams/pull/465#discussion_r70166919", "pull_request_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails-girls-summer-of-code/rgsoc-teams/pulls/465", "author_association": "OWNER", "_links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails-girls-summer-of-code/rgsoc-teams/pulls/comments/70166919"}, "html": {"href": "https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/rgsoc-teams/pull/465#discussion_r70166919"}, "pull_request": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails-girls-summer-of-code/rgsoc-teams/pulls/465"}}, "body_html": "<p>just noticed a minor typo: \"Rubucop\" instead of \"Rubocop\" <g-emoji class=\"g-emoji\" alias=\"innocent\" fallback-src=\"https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f607.png\">\ud83d\ude07</g-emoji></p>", "body_text": "just noticed a minor typo: \"Rubucop\" instead of \"Rubocop\" \ud83d\ude07"}
