Just thought, I'd share them in a separate PR, feel free to discard all of this if you where already aware of these things or if they just don't matter.\r\n\r\nTiny bit of background: on the way from Rails 3 to 4, they got rid of the `secret_token` initializer - I just remembered it was part of the [upgrade guide](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/upgrading_ruby_on_rails.html#config-secrets-yml). The Teams app already uses the new preferred way - the `secrets.yml` file, so the initializer is obsolete, all env vars are already set on Heroku.\r\n*This means one could then also remove the `RAILS_SESSION_SECRET` from the Heroku config.*\r\n\r\nSince January '15 Heroku also [recommends Puma](https://devcenter.heroku.com/changelog-items/594) as a webserver, due to some [severe problems with Unicorn](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-rails-applications-with-the-puma-web-server#slow-clients). I just added there default Puma config, it's approx. the same as the unicorn config before. Plus: I don't see a reason why not to use it in development as well.\r\n\r\nAs I said, feel free to discard these commits, I just wanted to not directly forget about these things when I saw them :v:",
