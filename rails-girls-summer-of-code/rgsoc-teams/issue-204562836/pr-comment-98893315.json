If your account has already been added by one of your team mates (for example, if they've added you to a team) then you'll claim your account\n-  by signing in through GitHub.\n-\n-  Once signed in, you can update your profile information. Please tell the\n-  community a little bit about you. Why are you participating, what you\n-  hope to get out of this, etc.\n-\n-  ### Your team's profile\n-\n-  On the [teams list](/teams) check if your team has already been added. If you're\n-  already part of a team then you can edit your team's profile.\n-\n-  If you haven't been added to your team, yet, then ask one of the members to\n-  sign in and add you. They will need your GitHub account name for that.\n-\n-  With your team's profile you and your team can tell the community about your project,\n-  how and where you plan to work, ... everything that might be useful or fun to know :)\n-\n-  If your team has a GitHub organization (you might want one and they're free\n-  for Open Source) then please add the handle. If your team has a Twitter\n-  account, then please add it, too. *Note: you can only add these once your team has officially been accepted as a RGSoC team.*\n-\n-  ### Your team's sources\n-\n-  Your team can register \"sources\" from which this application will try to\n-  aggregate updates; please add any blog that is relevant for your team by registering its RSS or Atom feed URLs. \n-\n-  Please also add all the GitHub repository URLs that you are planning to\n-  work on as sources.  Currently this won't actually do anything yet, but we\n-  plan to aggregate information from there, too.\n-\n-  ### Just ask!\n-\n-  If you think something is unclear or should be improved, or if you find a\n-  bug, then please [report an issue](https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/rgsoc-teams/issues).\n-\n-  Or email us at [contact@rgsoc.org](mailto:contact@rgsoc.org)\n-\n-  Or [tweet](https://twitter.com/RailsGirlsSoC) us :)\n+h1 Help\n+\n+.col-md-4\n+  h2 Site and account help\n+  ul\n+   li = link_to \"How to create an account\", \"create-an-account\"\n+   li = link_to \"How to create a team\", \"create-a-team\"\n+   li = link_to \"How to confirm your coach status\", \"confirm-a-coach\"\n+   li = link_to \"How to fill out your application\", \"fill-out-your-application\"\n+\n+.col-md-4\n+  h2 Program guides\n+  ul\n+   li = link_to \"Student's Application Guide\", \"http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/students/application/\"", "path": "app/views/pages/help.html.slim", "position": null, "original_position": 74, "commit_id": "322ffc9fa795e83209ba77f7273b0a4adf614530", "original_commit_id": "30dfa70b2f5595bea26525347514d657266c0b81", "user": {"login": "alicetragedy", "id": 3143348, "avatar_url": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3143348?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alicetragedy", "html_url": "https://github.com/alicetragedy", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alicetragedy/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alicetragedy/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alicetragedy/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alicetragedy/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alicetragedy/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alicetragedy/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alicetragedy/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alicetragedy/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alicetragedy/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "body": "could you remove the `'s` here? so just \u201cStudent Application Guide\u201d, \u201cCoach Guide\u201d, \u201cMentor Guide\u201d.", "created_at": "2017-02-01T13:34:30Z", "updated_at": "2017-02-01T14:50:37Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/rgsoc-teams/pull/637#discussion_r98893315", "pull_request_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails-girls-summer-of-code/rgsoc-teams/pulls/637", "author_association": "OWNER", "_links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails-girls-summer-of-code/rgsoc-teams/pulls/comments/98893315"}, "html": {"href": "https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/rgsoc-teams/pull/637#discussion_r98893315"}, "pull_request": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails-girls-summer-of-code/rgsoc-teams/pulls/637"}}, "body_html": "<p>could you remove the <code>'s</code> here? so just \u201cStudent Application Guide\u201d, \u201cCoach Guide\u201d, \u201cMentor Guide\u201d.</p>", "body_text": "could you remove the 's here? so just \u201cStudent Application Guide\u201d, \u201cCoach Guide\u201d, \u201cMentor Guide\u201d."}
