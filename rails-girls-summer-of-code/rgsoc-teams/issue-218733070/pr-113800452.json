I started extracting application_data into it's own class.\r\nRight now we just pass the hash around, which has a couple of drawbacks. We treat it like an AR Model but we are leaking the everywhere.\r\nThis introduce an API for ApplicationData which is easier to extend and maintain. It also brings us halfway to extracting application data into it's own AR model. \r\n\r\nit does not implement the setters yet. if we want to change application data, we still have to use the hash methods. Any input on that is appreciated. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think about the direction we are heading here?", "created_at": "2017-04-02T00:46:28Z", "updated_at": "2017-04-09T21:15:55Z", "closed_at":
