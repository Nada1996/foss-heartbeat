The main problem is that feedjira switched from `curb` to `faraday`as HTTP framework and therefor does not support `file://` URL's anymore.\r\nMy workaround is to server the local files over HTTP via a small webrick server. This allows us to upgrade Feedjira and still maintain the same test coverage. \r\n\r\nI also included a regular `bundle upgrade` which upgraded the AWS gem, but this is safe since we switched to the `2.x` version.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think about that approach.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nBen", "created_at": "2017-04-02T01:51:30Z", "updated_at": "2017-04-04T21:52:03Z", "closed_at":
