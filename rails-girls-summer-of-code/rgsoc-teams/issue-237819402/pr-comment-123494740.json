Our idea is to allow any sort of blog type tool for that (maybe\n recommend a few) and aggregate things through RSS in a central app. This app\n could then act as a webhook target for GitHub events.\n \n-Since we still are somewhat overwhelmed with the amount of work we'd like to\n-ask the community for help with this. The app would need to be available\n-(initial, basic version) on 1st of July, ideally a few days earlier.\n+We're really excited at how much this app has grown and developed, and are really \n+grateful for all of the community help along the way.
