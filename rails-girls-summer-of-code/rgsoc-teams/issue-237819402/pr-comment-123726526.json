Our idea is to allow any sort of blog type tool for that (maybe\n recommend a few) and aggregate things through RSS in a central app. This app\n could then act as a webhook target for GitHub events.\n \n-Since we still are somewhat overwhelmed with the amount of work we'd like to\n-ask the community for help with this.
