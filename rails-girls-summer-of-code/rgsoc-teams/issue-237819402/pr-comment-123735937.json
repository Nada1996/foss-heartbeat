The app also supports coaches and organizers\n+in centralizing the information they need to have to help keep RGSoC \n+running along smoothly. \n \n Main goals are:\n \n-* make it easy to get an overview of activity/progress for each of the teams for supervision\n-* make it easy for interested remote coaches to find opportunities to give support/help\n+* make it easy to get an overview of activity/progress for each of the teams \n+for supervision:\n+* make it easy for interested remote coaches to find opportunities to give \n+support/help\n+* keep administrative information and processes in one place\n * display to the world how much amazing stuff is happening\n \n We are planning to require teams to keep a daily log of short updates about\n their work. Our idea is to allow any sort of blog type tool for that (maybe\n recommend a few) and aggregate things through RSS in a central app. This app\n could then act as a webhook target for GitHub events.\n \n-Since we still are somewhat overwhelmed with the amount of work we'd like to\n-ask the community for help with this. The app would need to be available\n-(initial, basic version) on 1st of July, ideally a few days earlier.\n+We're really excited at how much this app has grown and developed, and are really \n+grateful for all of the community help along the way. There's still plenty to do \n+here - and we'd love to have your contributions!
