An `ApplicationForm` object already exists. I thought about naming the new class: `ApplicationFormData` or `ApplicationFormFields`. That describes the relation to the Form better, but there are more fields than just the personal ApplicantFields. \r\nAlso: should it be singular ApplicantField? \r\n  - 2 There is a separate SkillLevel class, that is a similar 'applicant field', and also used only in the form. Does it make sense to combine the ApplicantFields and SkillLevel into one class?\r\n  - 3 The  application form has a gender list field, but it doesn't show the select options as stated in `ApplicantFields::GENDER_LIST`.  \r\nhttps://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/rgsoc-teams/blob/0cf4b724db8085f8c78c6a56b2e9c31e4690e8c6/app/views/application_drafts/_student_fields.html.slim#L12
