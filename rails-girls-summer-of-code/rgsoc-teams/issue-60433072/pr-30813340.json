I have monkey patched Mail::Message to respond to `:deliver_later` in `config/initializers/monkey_patch_mail.rb`. I've done this to make upgrading to Rails 4.2 easier when we have ActiveJob available. It essentially puts the mailer in a background job. This should be removed when upgrading to 4.2 .\n2. I've added the [foreman gem](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman). It is nicer and easier to have your environment variables in a `.env` file. I've also added `.env` to the .gitignore file. I can update the readme to reflect this in the Mailtrap section.\n3. I had a bit of trouble with other tests failing because they were trying to deliver the email. I've set `action_mailer.raise_delivery_errors` to `false`. Let me know if this is unacceptable, and I'll find another way.\n\n![Wiggle](http://i.imgur.com/4nQacF3.gif)\n\nBed time!\n", "created_at": "2015-03-10T00:31:48Z", "updated_at":
