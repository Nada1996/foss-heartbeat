Rails upgraded to 4.2\n2. cancan has been replaced by [cancancan](https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan)\n3. All gems have been updated with the exception of [aws-sdk](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby), changes to the aws-sdk are significant, see the [upgrading nodes](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/blob/master/UPGRADING.md). This is perhaps justification for a separate issue.\n4. There were a number of deprecation warnings that have been solved, ~~there are still a few more left though~~.\n5. I have converted all mailers to use `deliver_later`, ActiveJob style. In doing so I have deleted all the workers.\n\nI had a problem with this https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/rgsoc-teams/commit/56207cd8d6ef37a7368194c7f8990f50476a343d see the commit description, I am not sure this is tested correctly.\n\nAlso in [comments_controller_spec.rb](https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/rgsoc-teams/blob/71cb736d9f84dfd967ce099821d48bac62916590/spec/controllers/comments_controller_spec.rb). I changed the spec to not test for the delivery, but for the enqueueing of the job. I'll run the coverage shortly to ensure the mailer is tested correctly.\n\nI also noticed two pending tests: `ApplicationsController as an authenticated user POST create creates a new application` and `ApplicationsController as an authenticated user POST create fails to create invalid record` make a lot of noise, but don't fail the tests.\n\n![make it
