We have split up the application creation process so people do not have to enter their, e.g. students or team details twice.\nThis change also splits up the rating process in the same way. I.e. ratings to students are given based on  student-related fields, ratings to teams are given based on team-related fields, etc.\nAlso, fields displayed are now sorted by, kinda, relevance and topic, on each of the respective pages.\nTODO\n\n After creating a rating for a student, redirect to the user rating page for the next student. once both students were rated, redirect to their team rating page, then their application pages. Then redirect to the next student on the next team, and so on.\n Have a todo list for selection committee members: Link to users, teams and applications that do not have a rating from current_user, yet.\n Fix sorting for some of the headers.\n Fix displaying the project name", "merged": true, "mergeable": null, "rebaseable": null, "mergeable_state": "unknown", "merged_by": {"login": "carpodaster", "id": 164400, "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/164400?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/carpodaster", "html_url": "https://github.com/carpodaster", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carpodaster/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carpodaster/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carpodaster/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carpodaster/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carpodaster/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carpodaster/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carpodaster/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carpodaster/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carpodaster/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "comments": 3, "review_comments": 6, "maintainer_can_modify": false, "commits": 8, "additions": 607, "deletions": 128, "changed_files": 28}
